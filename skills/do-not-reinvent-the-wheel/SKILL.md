# Do Not Reinvent the Wheel

## Core Principle

Before writing custom logic, check whether a well-maintained library already solves the problem. Using battle-tested packages leads to cleaner, more minimal code with fewer bugs, better edge-case handling, and lower maintenance burden.

## When Writing Code

1. **Pause before implementing**: If the task involves a common problem (date handling, validation, HTTP retries, deep merging, cron parsing, CSV/Excel generation, etc.), assume a library exists.
2. **Pick the right library**: Prefer packages that are actively maintained, widely adopted, and small in scope. A focused library beats a kitchen-sink framework.
3. **Add it as a dependency**: Use the project's package manager to install the latest version (`pnpm add <package>`). Do not manually copy library code.
4. **Search when unsure**: If you don't know a library that solves the task, **spawn a sub-agent to perform a web search** for one before writing custom code. Search for terms like `"npm <problem domain>"` or `"best node.js library for <task>"`.

## When Reviewing Code

Flag custom implementations that duplicate what a library already provides. Suggest the library alternative with a brief rationale (maintenance, edge cases, community support).

## Common Substitutions

| Instead of writing...                  | Use                                           |
| -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Custom date arithmetic                 | `date-fns` or `dayjs`                         |
| Hand-rolled schema validation          | `zod`, `valibot`, or `yup`                    |
| Manual deep clone / deep merge         | `lodash-es` (cherry-pick), `deepmerge`        |
| Custom retry / backoff logic           | `p-retry`, `async-retry`                      |
| DIY cron expression parsing            | `cron-parser`, `croner`                       |
| Regex-heavy email/URL validation       | `validator`                                   |
| Manual CSV/Excel generation            | `papaparse`, `exceljs`                        |
| Custom slugify                         | `slugify`                                     |
| Hand-rolled HTTP client wrappers       | `ky`, `got`, `ofetch`                         |
| Custom queue / job scheduling          | `bullmq`, `bee-queue`                         |
| Manual string template interpolation   | `handlebars`, `mustache`, `eta`               |

This table is illustrative, not exhaustive. The principle applies broadly.

## Decision Checklist

Before writing custom code, answer:

- [ ] Is this a problem someone else has already solved well?
- [ ] Would a library handle edge cases I might miss?
- [ ] Will custom code create maintenance burden for the team?
- [ ] Is the library lightweight enough to justify the dependency?

If the first three are **yes** and the last is **yes**, use the library.

## When Custom Code Is Fine

- The problem is highly specific to the domain and no library fits.
- The library would be a disproportionately heavy dependency for a trivial task (e.g., pulling in a full utility library for a single three-line function).
- Security-sensitive code that must be fully audited and owned.
